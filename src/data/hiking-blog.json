    "description":"Enjoy this 4.4-mile loop trail near Seattle, Washington. Generally considered an easy route, it takes an average of 1 h 45 min to complete.",
    "content":"Really beautiful trail, not that many people on it in the morning but it was 30 degrees so there might be more people when it’s warmer. Highly recommend bringing sunglasses because the sun reflects off the water after the lighthouse so it is hard to see and you definitely don’t want to miss those beautiful sights"

Trail under the Montlake bridge is an interesting add on. Arboretum is fascinating, even in the late fall!"

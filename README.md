# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains demo-code for the proposal of an interactive information web app called "Get To The Trail". It created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Currently it contains the one demo page showing the basic layout of the homepage we envisioned, as well as the problem domain and app description.

The features:

1. "Map" shows the map of Seattle with all the hiking routes highlighted on it. 

2. "Route" shows the information for each individual routes. We also envisioned that the user will click on one of the routes in the Map page and be redirected in to the routes page.
3. "Shop" shows the possible options of hiking  gear that the user can purchase.

        <h2>App Description:</h2>
        <p>The users for our application will be hikers and anyone who wants to get into hiking. It will allow them to determine which hike would be perfect for them. If you are new to Washington or live here and want to go on a hike, you can just use the website, and it will help you figure out what hike you are looking for. This website is excellent for people of all races and backgrounds because hiking is for everyone, and you rarely see people on your hikes, so you wonâ€™t feel like you are being targeted or being excluded. The website users can click on the map and see the hikes all over the maps. If you want to look for hiking gear or shoes to hike in, it will show you stores that sell that stuff. Our last feature will be tagging organizations which will list a bunch of organizations in the area that you could join.</p>
        <p>Our users will be able to see information like fun places to hike and uploaded outdoor images of hikes. You will be able to see information about the hike, what route to take, difficulties, elevation, and distance. Also, users can upload data about closed roads or hikes. This website will solve the problems by making it easier for people to go hiking and find hikes. It will also provide them with all the information in one without having to look elsewhere.</p>

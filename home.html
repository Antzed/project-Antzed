                <p>
                    Most people can agree that hiking is good for your health and also the best way to experience and appreciate the outdoors and the environment for all groups of ages ranging from middle childhood to adulthood and even old age. However, as beneficial hiking is, most people do not participate in it due to the accessibility of it. For many, beginner hikers are overloaded with the amount of trails in Seattle or they might just know some trails but most of them are far away and not really local. And especially for most beginners, they may not even know which ones to choose that fit their skill level. Many web applications such as <a href="https://www.wta.org/" arial-label="link to Washington Trail Association website"</a>Washington Trails Associations</a> are currently attempting to solve this problem through listing each trail in Washington however, we want to build a community for beginners and veterans to share their knowledge with all topics that relate with hiking. We want to address this problem through building our own web application.

            <!-- App Description -->
            <section>
                <h2>App Description:</h2>
                <p>The users for our application will be hikers and anyone who wants to get into hiking. It will allow them to
                    determine which hike would be perfect for them. If you are new to Washington or live here and want to go on
                    a hike, you can just use the website, and it will help you figure out what hike you are looking for. This
                    website is excellent for people of all races and backgrounds because hiking is for everyone, and you rarely
                    see people on your hikes, so you wonâ€™t feel like you are being targeted or being excluded. The website users
                    can click on the map and see the hikes all over the maps. If you want to look for hiking gear or shoes to
                    hike in, it will show you stores that sell that stuff. Our last feature will be tagging organizations which
                    will list a bunch of organizations in the area that you could join.
                    <br>Our users will be able to see information like 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Fun places to hike</li>
                    <li>Uploaded outdoor images of hikes</li>
                    <li>You will be able to see information about the hike, what route to take, difficulties, elevation, and
                    distance</li>
                    <li>Users can upload data about closed roads or hikes</li>
                    </ul>
                    This website will solve the problems by making it easier for people to go hiking and find hikes. It will also provide them with all the information in one without having to look elsewhere.
